### [@martinheidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger)

Hello! My name is Martin HEIDEGGER. I am 29 years old.
I am not a native english speaker. Much like the students, I also studied english from Junior Highschool. My mother-tongue is german. I come from the country-side of Austria where everybody has a strong dialect. When I finished my education my english was not any better than what I commonly hear in Japan.
The exchange with the international Open-Source community has helped me and my english skills a lot. Not just in regards to reading and writing but also improved my speaking skills. These days I can communicate my thoughts fluently in english and I thought that I can maybe share some of the lessons I learned with japanese developers!

Hello. I'm Hideyuki, 29 years old. I live in Ashiya-city, Hyogo, Japan.
I just started to learn about Html5/CSS/JavaScript in April 2014.
So: I know very little about programming.
But I am very excited thanks to the teacher and members of this class!!!
I know about "what is open source" "Twitter Bootstrap" for the first time in this class. Now I'm glad to got to use bootstrap easily like [this](http://geeks.secret.jp/) (this website is just a temporary example). 

I have respect for the developers, and I am very happy that I was able to spend time together. Thanks.
